        <h3>How to make crispy fried chicken?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To start, we cut the chicken wings. With a very sharp knife we cut them at the joint. The little tip that does not serve us, we remove it. It helps us make a broth with them, for example.</li>
            <li>We prepare what will be the exterior coating of our crispy fried chicken. We put the egg and milk in a deep plate and beat both ingredients. Until there is a cream-colored mixture without egg lumps.</li>
            <li>In another plate we prepare the other part of the breading. We add the flour, the breadcrumbs, the spices (you can add whatever you want, but the ones suggested in the ingredients section are very, very good) and we mix all the ingredients with our hands until they are all homogeneously mixed.</li>
            <li>We pass the wings through the flour, breadcrumbs and spices mixture, then through the egg and milk mixture and then again through the flour and breadcrumbs mixture. Make sure it is well coated with these ingredients. We reserve on a plate until we have finished breading all the wings.</li>
            <li>Once breaded, we put our crispy fried chicken wings in the refrigerator for an hour so that the outer breading sets well.</li>
            <li>Finally, we fry the wings in plenty of oil for about 5 minutes. The oil should be hot, but not too hot so that the wings fry well inside without the exterior breading burning.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That's how easy we will have a crispy breaded fried chicken that is delicious! A very easy and quick dish to make, for the whole family.</p>
